Card-Classes
 Instructions:
  execute 'python main.py' for demonstration of Classes

 Assumptions:
  1: Only good-path execution was needed for this test
  2: Only the named methods were needed for this test
  3: These classes might need to be used in a larger context

 Notes:
  I was not able to get card re-sorting to work, and for some reason, the len() of the lists is not reporting the correct length of 52, despite it appearing that only the 52 cards are represented, no duplicates, none missing.
